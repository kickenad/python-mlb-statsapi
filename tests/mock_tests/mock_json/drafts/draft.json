          "blurb" : "Raw and undrafted out of an Alabama high school three years ago, Mize has blossomed at Auburn and not only is a lock to join Gregg Olson (1988) and Frank Thomas (1989) as Tigers selected in the top 10 picks, but he's also the prohibitive favorite to go No. 1 overall. He has the best combination of stuff and control among college pitchers in the 2018 Draft, and he has proven he can stay healthy. Shut down last spring at Auburn and again during the summer with Team USA with a tired arm and a flexor strain in his forearm, he has had no issues this year. Mize can get swings and misses with three different pitches, the best of which is a mid-80s splitter that dives at the plate. He sets it up with a 92-97 mph fastball that he commands exceptionally well despite its running life. His mid-80s slider has taken a step forward this spring, consistently grading as a plus offering. Mize has an athletic frame and a clean delivery, so there's no glaring flaw that can be blamed for his health concerns. He pounds the strike zone, ranking first in NCAA Division I in K/BB ratio (12.1) and fourth in walks per nine innings (1.0) as a sophomore and posting similar numbers as a junior. Scouts also love the way he competes on the mound.",
